# Spring boot Crud with views

Hi, now that I've handled more essential concepts about Spring boot, I made a Crud
but with views, not a rest api.

It's PRETTY BASIC, I didn't apply too much efforts on views because I need to learn
more stuff.

Some labels in the buttons are not visible because I'm just using a nested <a></a> tag for
the redirects.

The extra I ADDED HERE WAS the Spring Session JDBC for creating sessions in the 
mysql database and protecting the routes of course.

Pretty basic stuff, It's just that I'm slow programming things, and more slow when it's not new or fun.
